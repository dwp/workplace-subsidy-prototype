<h2 class="govuk-heading-m ">The process for employers</h2>

<p>1: <a href="/phoenix/employer/v11/start-page">Check if your business is eligible </a>and get a discount code.</p>

<p>2: Search the list of providers and book an assessment.</p>

<p>3: Give the provider your discount code.</p>

<p>4: After the assessment, receive advice about free or funded onward support for your employee.</p>

<p>5: Pay the provider. They will send you an invoice.</p>

<p>You can use this scheme for all your employees.</p>
<p>An employee can have as many assessments as they like, but you will need to get a new code each time.</p>
<p>Discount codes do not expire.</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m ">What an assessment will cost</h2>

<p>An assessment will cost between £20 and £80 after the 80% discount.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m ">Why the cost of assessments differ</h2>
<p>The price can be different depending on:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

<li>the complexity of the case</li>
<li>the type of health care professional that does the assessment</li>
</ul>

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
<p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">  Examples</p>

<p>Sam has a video call assessment with a nurse. It costs £150, so his employer pays £30.
</p>
<p>Emma has a video call with an occupational therapist It costs £250, so her employer pays £50.
</p>
</div>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m ">What happens if there are travel costs</h2>

<p>Most assessments will be by video call, but some may need to be in person. This can involve extra costs due to travel.</p>

<p>You can claim for travel costs related to an assessment. The 80% discount applies up to a full cost of £400. You will need to pay any remaining costs above £400.</p>

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
<p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">  Examples</p>

  <p>Joe has an in-person assessment with an occupational therapist. It costs £200 and the travel costs £40, bringing the total to £240. His employer pays £48.
</p>
  <p>Kat has an in-person assessment with a doctor. The assessment costs £370 and the travel costs £50, bringing the total to £420. Her employer pays £100 in total.
</p>

</div>




<h2 class="govuk-heading-m ">If an employee needs to cancel an assessment</h2>

<p>Cancellation of an assessment might result in a fee.</p>

<p>You need to check with the workplace health provider what their cancellation policy is.</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m ">If an employee does not attend an assessment</h2>

<p>You will have to pay for the full cost of an assessment if your employee does not attend.</p>

<p>Reassuring and reminding your employee about the assessment process means they are more likely to attend.</p>
