  <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Find an occupational health provider</h1>

      <p>
        Search the list to find a provider who can give you a discounted occupational health assessment for your employee.  </p>
      <p>  Select a provider then use the details provided to contact them directly. The provider will talk to you about:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>  how complex your employee's situation is</li>
<li>  who they recommend to do the assessment - this could be a doctor, nurse or other health professional </li>
</ul>

<p>  They'll also talk to you about whether they need to see your employee in person. This could be for a range of reasons, such as: </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>  your employee has communication difficulties</li>
<li>  the provider may need to assess their workspace</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">

What the assessment will cost  </h2>

<p>If you’re eligible for the 80% discount, the assessment will usually cost between £20 and £80.  </p>
<p>The actual cost of an occupational health (OH) assessment from our service is normally between £100 and £400.</p>

      Why the cost of an assessment varies
    </span>
  </summary>
  <div class="govuk-details__text">
    The cost of an assessment may vary due to factors such as:
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>the method of delivery. Most assessments will be by phone or video conference. However, some assessments may need an in-person or onsite meeting. These will usually involve an extra cost.
</li>
<li>  the complexity of the case. For example, a case involving a broken arm may be more straightforward than a case involving a sensitive mental health condition.
</li>
<li>  who carries out the assessment. Some assessments can be done by a physiotherapist, while others may require a nurse or a doctor.
</li>
</ul>
  </div>
</details>



<p>The final cost will usually be discussed and agreed upon during the initial conversation between the employer and the OH provider they have selected.
  </p>
  <p>The 80% discount only applies up to an assessment cost of £400.
    </p>

  <p>In some cases where an in-person assessment has been agreed, there may be additional travel costs. Any further costs over £400 are not discounted.   </p>

<p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold govuk-!-margin-bottom-1">Example 1</p>

<p>A telephone assessment by a physiotherapist.<br>
Cost £100. Final cost to employer with 80% discount = £20</p>

<p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold govuk-!-margin-bottom-1">Example 2</p>

<p>A video conference assessment by a doctor.<br>
Cost £300. Final cost to employer with 80% discount = £60</p>
<p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold govuk-!-margin-bottom-1">Example 3</p>

<p>An in-person assessment by a doctor, at the employee’s workplace.<br>
Cost £350 plus £100 travel costs. Final cost to employer with 80% discount = £130</p>
<p>In this case the total cost including travel is £450. The 80% discount applies up to £400, and the remaining £50 cost above this is paid in full by the employer.</p>

  </details>








<p>If your employee does not attend the appointment as arranged, you will have to pay 100% of the cost. However, regular and open engagement with your employee about the assessment process can reduce the chances of non-attendance.</p>
